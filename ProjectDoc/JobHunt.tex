\section{Introduction} % Top level section

I need a job. I'm out of money. I have a background that should be able to get me something decently paying, assuming I'm not already too old to sell my rather patchy experience level. I'm creating this document because I need some structure to my efforts, and I'm really not sure how to go about that. At least I can attempt to journal my efforts and ideally move toward some system of directing and tracking them.

This is not the first I've done one LinkedIn, but it is the first I've done since creating this document.

LinkedIn sent this in an email, and I saw junior and data so I did the quick apply. Seeing now the words Utah and IT on the listing, I'm much less interested.

\section[2 Dec: LinkedIn]{Some More Lame LinkedIn Jobs -- 2023-12-02} % Top level section

More LinkedIn. 

Thinking about job hunting: LinkedIn is bullshit. It's just something to do. It is the job hunting demo. The most basic thing I can do is what I'm doing, which is easy apply on LinkedIn. One by one I need to begin adding additional strategies. Tailoring resume to types of jobs. Tailoring resume to specific jobs. Writing cover letters. Implementing public AI tools. Seeking well fitting jobs. Using tools besides LinkedIn. Researching specific jobs and employers. Utilizing my network. Developing my network more. Of course continuing my educational development, though that is more outside the scope of this document. 

I do need to pick up the pace though. I'm really backed into a corner here, and come up with a more concrete plan. The LinkedIn easy apply really is zero effort, so maybe I just increase the number of those I do each day, while also planning out further efforts. Perhaps I start reading articles and see what there is to see there.

\section[3 Dec: Structuring]{Adding Some Structure to my Plan -- 2023-12-03} % Top level section

I'm really struggling with this and I don't know why. 

I'm on LinkedIn now. I want to add some other job boards to that. GitHub, ITJobPro, Toptal, Dice, Upwork.

Mentioning upwork, freelancing is something to try to make progress with.

Developing resume means working on the actual thing, as well as learning JS and then react to build an online resume which will then develop into a portfolio. 

I need to learn Data Science. 

I need to network. 

I need to stop being high because someone gave me an edible last night and I'm still fubar.

\section[9 Dec: Workflow Idea]{Let's Plan Some Upgrades to the Job Hunt Tracking -- 2023-12-09} % Top level section

I want to add some automation to this document. I want to build an program that will let me type this stuff into a database, and then pull that info and pump it into the tex file. Further, I want to make system very segmented, so I can have fully functioning pieces before I have a fully functioning whole. 

First would be a form to take an entry in and store it as an object. This object could then be saved as a json or passed directly to the next part. Function would build the form, validate the entires, and return the input as an object. 

Next an object would be written to a database. That object could be pulled form a json or not. The function could be given either an object or a filename, and it can act accordingly. 

Next, an object would be retrieved from the database, and possibly written to a json. It would return an object given specifying info such as a date. This output could be fed into a json writer. 

Next, the object or json is written to the tex file. Again, function can figure out what the argument is and proceed accordingly. 

Next, a controller would read the tex file and the database to determine if the tex requires updating, and then call the previous functions. If the last entry in the tex file is earlier than the last entry in the database, it will retrienve all the missing dates. If they are the same date, it does nothing. If the last tex is later than the last database row, an error is thrown. 

Also, I think that a new rule I should include for this process. Following up on a job counts as one of the applications required for that day. So tomorrow I could apply to 8 jobs and follow up on two.

\subsection[Sunco]{Sunco: video interview}

I was a coward and left this until 4 in the morning. Also, this is the only thing for this day I'm doing before going to bed. Still, I did it, I'm uploading it now. It kinda sucks, but

1) Tell me about a situation at work that showcases your work ethic and your professionalism.

In my role as project manager at the Bayeux Group, we faced a tight deadline on an integral piece of data architecture for a client. The client had requested a sooner launch date for the software than originally planned. Recognizing both the importance of promptness for the client, and the realities of the project in question, I negotiated a new timeline while expanding the team in order to make that timeline a come to pass. The importance of this situation for me was both the sober assessment of what could be delivered, and the honest communication of that assessment to the stakeholders of the project. 

2) Tell me about a time where you did not meet expectations for a client or a superior and what did you do about that.

I was acting as a project manager for a construction company. They had a job in an area they had not previously done any work. Because it was a new area, the permits were filed incorrectly, an error I was not aware of until late in the project. It's important to note that I was acting under contract for the construction company -- professionally, they were my client. The project, however, was for a homeowner's renovation of their new residence. In the short term, the most lucrative option for the construction company would have been to string the homeowner along while we sorted out the permit issue. However, I made the decision to bring in another contractor to finish the project, which, while cutting into my client's profits, greatly expidited and simplified completion of the project, and ultimately left my client with a satisfied customer. I took responsibility for the permit issue and I wasn't assigned to that construction company again. I stand by the decisions I made. 

3) If this season of your life had a mission what would it be and what steps would you take to accomplish it?

I've spent a lot of my life learning a lot of different things. I have developed myself with the guiding belief that to build productive bridges between different domains and professions, you have to have some understanding what is on either side of the divide. My mission now is to put that theory to the test. I have the breadth, and now I want the depth. I want to focus on one profession, and use my breadth of knowledge to help my customers and help my team interface with the many other professions and domains of knowledge our roles will have us interacting with.

\begin{quote}
	Dear Ms. Sridevi,

	I am very interested in the Generative AI Engineer position. I think I would be a great fit and I'm going to go through point by point why, hopefully giving you a sense of who I am along the way.

	I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and I've done machine learning research in the past. I'm strongly interested in the whole field of artificial intelligence, and I want to explore it further to learn where in that field I could best fit.

	I have strong problem solving skills. As I mentioned, I have machine learning research experience, specifically using machine learning to test the limits of differential privacy. I've also been involved in the launch and growth of several small businesses -- roles which were almost exclusively problem solving, each in their own way.

	I am experienced in both Python and SQL. My research was implementing machine learning models in python using SciKitLearn and Jupyter notebooks. In the business world, I've designed and implemented SQL databases for corporate operational data using MariaDB, Python, Django, and JavaScript.

	My soft skills come most demonstrably from my business experience. I've worked on teams; I've organized and led teams, and I've worked independently. I've done high-end contract work for customers who demanded attention to detail in every regard. Your ideal candidate should be comfortable working in a dynamic environment, and I have happily operated in spaces where my role was in constant flux.

	For these reasons and more, this role and I would be a perfect fit for one another, and I hope you'll consider me a strong candidate.

	Yours sincerely,

\section[22 Dec: Last Day before PA]{Last Day before PA -- 2023-12-22} % Top level section

The original plan is bust. I fell too far behind. I'm going to do whatever I get done today, and maybe spend the travel-heavy day tomorrow thinking about a restructure. I am concerned about the amount I'm getting done in general. I mean, I'm still just skimming the W3 course. I have done a few small coding challenges. And I have fallen behind on the basic job hunt stuff without making much progress for a couple weeks on improving my application. I haven't even implemented Carly's advice yet.
