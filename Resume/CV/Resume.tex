%	BIO SECTION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{rSection}{Bio}

I'm Elliot, a programmer, entrepreneur, writer (I tell myself), and recent \textit{cum laude} graduate of Bucknell University. My passion is elegant design. There's beauty to a program well written, a project well managed, and a start up well planned.  I like to challenge my own assumptions by leaping feet first out of my comfort zone and into new and diverse environments that push me to try harder, to listen and learn more, and to meet interesting new people.

Currently a Project Manager and Software Developer with The Bayeux Group, I have over five years of managing software projects and teams while balancing my career with my education. In my current position, I designed and developed a new project tracking platform in C++ that allowed us to more efficiently collaborate while taking the pressures of tracking progress off people and onto servers.

\end{rSection}

\begin{rSection}{Bio}

A \textit{cum laude} computer science graduate of Bucknell University, has been involved with the launch and operations of several small businesses. Co-authored a paper on the gamification of electronics education and is currently working on a second paper on $\epsilon$-Differential Privacy protections against adversarial knowledge assumptions; exploring how to exploit the rich world of late â€˜80s video games. \\
