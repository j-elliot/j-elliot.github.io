You will not find another applicant like me. I can communicate with people who don't have a computer science background because I have a background much more diverse than computer science. Job Target helps recruit for many industries. As a plumber and electrician I have sold myself and my company to customers and engaged with tradesmen on my own and other teams on projects large and small. As a project manager at The Bayeux Group I learned to communicate and coordinate with executives and owners of large and small companies and to form and develop my own teams for sales and logistic initiatives. You won't hire me because I've spent my life behind a computer unit testing C++ and running privacy analyses in Python. You'll hire me because I can understand the needs of any stakeholder while respectfully and clearly communicating to them the opportunities and limitations that exist in a software solution to their needs.
