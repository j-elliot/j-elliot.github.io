The Revolution was horrific, death and misery for many, as revolutions tend to bring. Also opportunity for some few, as revolutions tend to bring. As the Mad Machine Man activated his army of cyborgs, his Hybrid Future, the value of unit testing code, especially the code that keeps your army in a state of slavery to your will becomes highly apparent.
Of course, he did succeed in claiming the system, or at least all of it that matters. His code held in the vast majority of cases, and the Orbital Governance Body capitulated when their Interplanetary fleet was turned against them. But testing every case of a battle system involving human components was impossible. Some cases slipped. An integral hardware fail-safe was bypassed when one cyborg's mind was uploaded into a science vessal's computer systems. Another case developed in reaction to the necessities of building assassins. The Mad Machine Man had a good understanding of the brain, and how to integrate silicon into synapse to his advantage. He wanted to control his subjects, and humans have a built in mechanism of control: the conscious. Morals. Social conformism. Sodiers can function from a place of ethics, fighting for their communities, even if that community is a brainwashed army of cyborgs and their mad creator/overseer. One profession that is inimical to ethical functioning is assassin.
To kill effectively and without remorse, defects had to be added to the moral structures in the minds of the assassins. In certain cases, those defects combined with the control firmware returned unexpected results.
Two such returns were Demetria and Ivan. They were assigned to eliminate a list of targets deemed likely to be resistant to the new order. They succeeded in ticking several boxes, several humans murdered on the toilet, in their beds, or guarding other humans. They felt no remorse for these slayings, but were intrigued by the nature of human suffering and death. They met their match in one of their targets.
Councilor Zar was an impressive man. Thoughtful in a way that could be mistaken for mild by those too foolish to realize the power behind his calm. He was cleverly defended, both with guards and with circumstance. He surrounded himself with valuable materials that an enemy would not choose to bomb, in locations where attackers would have to approach in person, unarmed.
And so the duo did. A formal ball for many political and economic elites. A hit that required as much planning as any, gaining entrance, preventing any detection of their enhancements, using the party as cover to access the Councilor's study, and waiting for him to retire there after the guests had gone home.
He was siting down to read. They watched as he made quick work of a report, and then continued on to a novel, a classic from the last days of the Earth. He had taste. They stepped into sight, and he betrayed no surprise, even as he sent a panic signal that they could both sense and block.
"A lot of effort to go through to tell me you hated my position on the curfew debacle," he said. Demetria stepped closer. They had both had to abandon weapons to gain access to the party. This killing would be intimately close.
"A polite chuckle would have been appreciated. Well, the relationship of the politician and the assassin is as old as it no doubt is deserved. Before you force my retirement on me, however, may I offer you a refreshment?"
He stood up not slowly, but deliberately, telegraphing that he was no threat, and went to the cabinet. He reached for one bottle, then changed his mind and drew out another. A warm looking brown liquid.
"This is a liquor not unlike bourbon, though it possesses its own unique charms derived from the geolocal flora." He poured three glasses. Then winking "if you allow me to finish this drink, I can promise you my undying gratitude."
Demetria let a short laugh slip, and Zar smiled, handing them each their drink.
***Are we really going to let him stall us?*** Demetria asked, using their link, though she was asking with an answer in mind. The question was weighted. She was more interested in continuing this conversation than Ivan was.
***Kill him then. He is at our mercy.*** But she didn't move to approach.
"You are cyborgs, correct? Sent by the man on the fringe. I warned them he would not accept his exile. That he was capable of creating an existential threat to not only our regime, but to human nature itself. And here you two are, the embodiment of both."
"Human nature is overrated," said Demetria.
"You see, now that's just what I wanted to ask you about." He took a sip of his drink. "If I must die tonight, at least allow me the great pleasure of looking into the face of the future. If you are to replace us, tell me what it is to be you."
"If we are the future," said Ivan, "then the future is slavery."
"Much of the past and present is also slavery. The poor our always slaves to their next meal. The middle are slaves to their next distraction. And those such as myself are slaves to our ambition. I'm disappointed to hear you say this, though. For all his desire to ascend, it seems the madman  has only forced human folly onto his machines." Another sip. "May I ask, how has he accomplished this slavery?"
Here there was hesitation. Ivan and Demetria had personalities, they had unique drives and responses. But sitting on top of what made them individuals was a device. It was an inorganic implant that reached into their minds like a spider and played puppeteer with tiny threads. It read what was happening, and it decided how to feel about that. They could hesitate as they decided how best to handle the given situation, but now this known adversary and target had made a request for secret information. He was a threat. This was bad. They were being asked to share secrets. This was bad. They were being asked to share secrets with an enemy and a threat while being manipulated into delaying their mission. This was very bad. The spider sensed this through its silken strands, and it tugged on another strand to send a signal to its host. Say nothing. End the game. Finish the mission. To do otherwise would be ***wrong***.
Demetria tilted her head forward, and her eyes disappeared into the shadows of her face. Her lips twisted into half smile, half snarl. She looked evil. She looked evil because she felt evil. Ivan started forward to kill the Councilor, and Demetria put her hand out to stop him.
"You want our secrets," she whispered. "Fine, I'll tell you. They use our humanity to make us slaves."
"Demetria," Ivan warned.
"They plug into our conscience, tell us what is right and wrong."
"Demetria, stop."
"I'm told everyone has a conscience, like a little voice that makes them not feel good when they're bad."
***Stop this and let me kill him or I'll have to stop you myself!***
"Except for us, the implants make that little voice screech in our heads. Anything unapproved makes us feel revolting. Only when we do as we're told are we not disgusting little worms in the muck."
Ivan tried to push past her, to lunge at the Councilor, but she caught his arm and with a deft shift of her weight, flung him through a book case.
"You know what makes me special, Ivan?" she shouted after him. "I like being a little worm in the muck! Fuck them and their screaming. I'm sick of listening. I'm sick of feeling like shit every time I don't think right. I'll be the goddamned worm!"
Two guards rushed in at the commotion. She whipped her glass at one with enough force to break his neck. she covered the distance to the other before his eyes could process the scene before. She plunged her hand through his chest.
"I will eventually get bored of killing your men, Councilor. I suggest you give them the all clear."
Zar, silent, sent a different signal from his panic system. This one she allowed through.
"Perhaps you'd be so kind as to pour me another refreshment." She spoke as demurely as any simpering coquette at the recently ended event "I seem to have dropped mine."
He did an admirable job keeping his hand steady as he poured another drink and handed it to her. She took it with her still bloody hand. Ivan climbed out of the wreckage of the bookcase, staring warily at his partner. 
"They need killers." said Zar. "Assassins can't have a fully formed counscience, or they wouldn't be able to do their jobs."
"A glitch." said Ivan with dawning realization. He squeezed his eyes shut as though trying to not see something bright. 
"Undefined output." said Demetria. "A deliberate miscalibration of a package with a dependancy. You're just asking for problems."
