Sharasa entered the bridge, the control room, room A{} of the time city. With a simple push of her thoughts, the city shifted into a new reality, and the vampiress teleported down to the world below her. 
The concert had not started yet. The singers were warming up with a{}-a-a-aaa's, and the instrumentalists with fine tunings of their precious instruments. 
Sharasa, now in a fine cocktail dress, sat down in a booth granted her by bribe. The usher gave her a program. Listed under a{} was Fuer Elise. She smiled and leaned back.
Her perfect ears picked up someone tuning an instrument, C to C, E to E, B to B, A{} to A. He was going to have to hurry. The song would begin soon.
Fuer Elise played, one flustered instrumentalist short, followed by Ode to Joy in A{}. In the latter, the off-key Cello played, but with his A{} string tuned to F. Because of him, the performance was not grade A{}, though the concert hall was roughly an A{} in shape. 
Sharasa sipped a{} tasteless dring ad listened to a{} few more songs, all of a{} classical type, scanning the audience. There was not a{} powerful person besides herself there. She was dissappointed, but she was hardly expecting a{} Hurculese to just happen to be in attencance. Now bored, she took another sip of what she realized was a{} light red wine. She shook her head. It was certainly not worth two thousand a{} bottle.
A child with black eyes and indefiniably colored hair came up and sat beside her.
"I would a{} been here sooner but..." he began, then shrugged. "Well, I wasn't."
"My lazy darling," said Sharasa.
"An a{}talented group," Endless commented.
"Shall we send the a{}sea?"
"You would interrupt them a{}singing?"
"Perhaps they could sing a{}bow a ship."
"And the ship would run them over a{}swim."
Sharasa gave a mild laugh.
"Enough nonsense."
