They were an old family. Old world money and power. They were dirty, as one might expect, not exactly having stood in protest of colonial excesses, or denouncing the legitimacy of the crusades. More than traditional exploitation of their fellow man, however, the LeGris Family exploited the inhuman. While others were extracting gold from Africa, they extracted secrets. When others sent opium to Asia, they sent their sons and daughters to study in ancient fortresses of knowledge. In the Americas, where other's fought wars over sugar, they were battling forces of other worlds.

They are of French origin. At least that's where their own records of themselves begin, and no one has a more authoritative tale to tell. They held to the fringe. Rich, mysterious, loner sorts. Some avoided court intrigue out of fear, or principles, or simple disgust. The LeGris simply found it dull. Their secrets were far more fascinating and valuable. Their friends could whisper to them all they needed to know of the happenings of the day.
