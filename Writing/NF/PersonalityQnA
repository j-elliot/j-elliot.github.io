To what degree is personality innate or learned?
Do you say "To what degree is a house foundation and non-foundation?" Nature informs what results nurture may have. 

Why are people different from one another?
Genetic recombination.

How do groups differ from one another in their psychology?
Wouldn't that be sociology?

Can human beings know God?
Sure.

Are mind and body the same?

Dr. Evil

Furtively.

What is my future?
Death (and taxes).

Is it?

Is it possible to have a science of psychology?
You should hope so. This class is costing a lot of money if it's all a fraud.

Where is personality?
Semi meaningless question. While there are areas of the brain associated with personality traits, the personality itself is a non-material construct based on the relationships of certain dynamic material objects (neurons, brain structures, et cetera) have to one another.

What do we know when we know a person?
Inputs and outputs.

How does personality work?
I would argue that mine does not.

At the corpus callosum.

Again, you're charging a lot of money to be asking these questions now.

How is personality expressed in the situation?
Inputs and outputs.

Why do people stay the same or change?
People don't change in any way that matters.
