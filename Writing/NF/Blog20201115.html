                              <div class="basic_para">I was thinking today about flow. Sort of a workflow sort of flow. Only for writing. Writing like this. I had begun writing this sort of thing on Medium, but Medium kind of bugs me. I get that everyone needs to make money, but do they need to make it so obvious? Anyway, I don't want to hand them my writing on the silver platter of the terms and conditions that (shocking reveal), I've never read. I don't know what rights I purportedly hand over with them, but I have a decent idea of what I hand over with GitHub, where this is hosted. So the flow then becomes, here on my website first, and then copies or modifications of what's here onto other platforms. Medium, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, MySpace just to be an ass. Wherever is appropriate for the particular work, in whatever format is appropriate, all linking back here, and, if I see fit, to each other.
                              </div>
                              <div class="basic_para">Great. Awesome. But why? What's the point? Where am I trying to go with this? I'm trying to get back on track. A journal helps me reinforce and reflect on what I learn, and making it public forces me to do it better and puts out there what I'm working on. The goal is to become a better writer and a better everything else through writing.
                              </div>
                              <div class="basic_para">So what I've been working on lately, for today's post. I don't trust our power company. Now, before I get sued, I'm not claiming they've done anything. The problem is that we got solar panels installed on our roof awhile back, and those panels came with a nifty app for tracking their production. The numbers that we get from that app don't seem to jive intuitively with what we're seeing on our bills. Critically, the amount we spend per month seems that it should have dropped more. Certainly, we could be using more power, but without a more granular view of our usage, that's hard to say. We don't know why we would be, and thus the distrust. To gain satisfaction in this matter, I've been looking at how power monitoring systems. Then I look at the prices of those systems and I stop looking at them. Instead, I decided I could build one. My goal is to build a multi-input, clamp on power metering system that connects to the internet, for a lot less money than they are sold for. The cheapest that I've found just the clamp on ammeter components for is around $10, and multiplied over 40+ potential circuits, that adds up, before I buy even one device to read their output. Instead of that, I asked how are these things built. Electrical induction, while not a simple concept, is also not an unapproachable one. I don't have the math for most of how induction works, but I do get that electric waves make amgnetic waves. Magnetic waves make electric waves. Thus those clamp on ammeters are, possibly just simple transformers. Current in the primary induces current in the secondary, more efficiently if you have a ferrous thing for the magnetic fields to follow. I wondered if an actual magnet would work for the ferrous material but an experiment showed that it did not, and reflecting I can see why. The magnetic field induced by the primary has to align the alignable bits in the secondary, which in turn reinforce that field and induce current in the secondary. A magnet isn't alignable. It just is what it is. So instead I looked around and found a clamp on noise filter, which I had a few of from the warehouse. Testing with a magnet showed that it was ferrous, and testing with steel showed that it was not magnetic. Performing the same experiment with this new component Yielded fruitful results. Voltage appeared on the secondary corresponding to whether the primary was conducting current or not. These things are cheap, and I can wire it all myself. Nothing special. But I do need to make a chart of some experiments, with variables including the current in the primary, the number of winds, and secondary voltage as a dependant variable.

                              <div class="basic_para">So that's the story today. I don't really have the whole flow thing up and running yet, but giving me time. I'll write more about it as I figure out what I'm doing.
